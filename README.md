Install Bandcochon
==================

This shell script is design to install BandCochon as simply as possible.

Installation
------------

Either you download the zip file or you clone the repository. 

You also may use `wget https://raw.github.com/PrinceCuberdon/InstallBandCochon/master/install_bandcochon.sh`

I think this is the prefered way.


Usage
-----

* Download and install `install_bandcochon.sh` in the parent directory of your
website installation. 
* Open a shell in the directory
* Change execute mode with `chmod a+x install_bandcochon.sh`
* Type `./install_bandcochon.sh [YOUR_DESTINATION_DIR]` optionnally if previous bandcochon v2 
  web site was installed, set the source directory  (you'll normaly never use it, it's here for 
  historical reasons).
